            <p>I'm Barnaby, the 14-year-old legal guru of Humanitarian Operations. My legal team have written a Donations Policy. But be careful because it has nothing to do with a Dough Nation which is a shame coz I was really excited by the sound of that coz I love eating cookie dough ice cream - maybe I will make my own country called Dough Nation.</p> 
            <p>Please read on below to see the entire Donations Policy which my legal team wrote - it's really important to understand.</p>

            <p>This Policy governs the individual one-off and regular donations made by payment services provided through our website humanitarianoperations.org or bank transfers. This policy applies separately to each single donation that you make.</p>
            <p>Except as provided for in Regular Donations (see below) and unless specified, they do not form a contract allowing for future or successive transactions to be set up.</p>

            <ul className="list-content">
              <li>A donation, often known as a gift, is a philanthropic transfer of funds made by an individual or organisation for the benefit of a charity.</li>
              <li>HOPE actively seeks and can accept donations from the following sources in accordance with the conditions mentioned below:</li>
              <li>Donations from individuals in the UK and overseas;</li>
              <li>Grants from charitable trusts and foundations in the UK and overseas;</li>
              <li>Donations from companies in the UK and overseas;</li>
              <li>Donations from legacy bequests;</li>
              <li>Grants from the UK government or their agencies and foundations;</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div className="slim-text-block blue-text top-spacing sideImg">

              )
            )}
            <h2 className='heading-bottom-spacing centered-text'>Refusal of donations or gifts</h2>
            <p>We will accept most donations and will only refuse and return donations in exceptional circumstances.</p>
            <p>We have entire discretion to refuse a donation if we believe that the donor is involved in activities that appear to be in direct conflict with our charitable goals and objectives or in violation of any current guidelines. We will always have the charity's overall best interests in mind when deciding whether or not to accept a donation. We will use your donation as we see fit, but only to further our stated charity goals.</p>
            <p>HOPE will not accept donations where the sources or naming of a gift falls short of the standards determined through the procedures for the ethical review of grants and:</p>
            <ul className="list-content">
              <li>Could cause detriment to the charity's reputation;</li>
              <li>Will disproportionately decrease the amount of donations to further the work of the charity, undermine our vision and values;</li>
              <li>Are from individuals, groups or organisations which are known to take advantage of vulnerable people;</li>
              <li>Personal gifts to Humanitarian Operations' staff members, which should be discouraged at all times;</li>
              <li>Originate from unknown sources of funding and can potentially harm our relationships with other donors, service users, stakeholders or volunteers;</li>
              <li>May have been illegally or unethically obtained;</li>
              <li>Cash donations will not be accepted under any conditions; </li>
              <li>Are from organisations that might use their funding relationship with HOPE to distract criticism from their own involvement in human rights abuses, or with whom association would significantly risk our reputation.</li>
              <li>A donation is found to have been solicited from a donor who does not have full capacity to make the donation (including being a minor) and/or where undue pressure has been exerted to solicit the donation (either directly or by a third party we are working with) and there is evidence to support this position. </li>
              <li>A genuine error has been made in monies arriving in our bank account which were not intended for us or where a double donation has been made in error.</li>
              <li>Where monies have been taken from a card during a period of fraud or identity theft and this is confirmed in writing by the card company and/or relevant authorities such as the police.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Note, that we accept donations from a variety of organisations - trusts, foundations, companies, commercial organisations and unions - where there will be a benefit to our human rights work, without compromising our mission, independence and credibility.</p>

            )}
            <h2 className='heading-bottom-spacing centered-text'>Safeguarding against illegal donations</h2>
            <p>We will take all reasonable steps to determine the ultimate source of funding for each donation and ensure that the funds are in no way connected with any illegal activity. We operate the Charity Commission's 'Know your Donor' principle and will make reasonable and appropriate attempts to identify any individual or organisation that gives us financial support. Particularly where significant sums are being donated, or the circumstances of the donation give rise to notable risk.</p>
            <p>All gifts and offers of support from organisations and governments will be screened against a set of ethical and human rights guidelines in accordance with our fundraising procedures. If we reject a gift or offer of support, we will give you an explanation for our decision.</p>
            <p>Research on donors and prospects in line with our Privacy Policy is an acceptable and intrinsic part of fundraising. Data surrounding individuals and companies who wish to be associated with Humanitarian Operations will be stored in a confidential file. It must be emphasised that any approaches undertaken by Humanitarian Operations will be handled in a sensitive and appropriate manner and comply with current data protection legislation.</p>
            <p>We may only accept anonymous individuals, or trust donations where there has been a rigorous third-party due diligence process, to confirm that HOPE is not potentially compromised. If a supporter makes themselves known to Humanitarian Operations but wishes their gift to remain anonymous, we will honour these wishes, on the basis that the donation carries no significant reputational risk. All anonymous donations of Â£25,000 or more will be reported to The Charity Commission as a serious incident (in line with current Charity Commission guidelines) and will follow the Humanitarian Operations' guidance on the handling of such donations.</p>
            <p>If a donation is received which may not be acceptable under the terms of this policy, the Head of Finance will alert the Trustees at the earliest opportunity. This will be researched further and the matter will be referred to the board with the necessary information regarding the donation.</p>
