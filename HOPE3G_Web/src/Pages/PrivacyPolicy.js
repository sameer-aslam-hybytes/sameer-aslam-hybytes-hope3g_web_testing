            I’m Barnaby, the 15-year-old legal guru of Humanitarian Operations
            and HOPE 3G. It’s important that you understand our Privacy Policy.
            That’s because it’s about protecting your private stuff – that’s
            what my legal team told me. At first I thought my private stuff is
            already perfectly safe where it is so I don’t need a new policy to
            protect it. However, apparently it actually refers to your private
            info – not your stuff, like a toy box or soft toys, so I’ve told my
            legal team to be more careful with their language in the future.
            <br />
            <br />I bet you are asking yourself, what does their Privacy Policy
            mean? We promise to respect and protect your private info just like
            the law says. We just use a tiny bit of info to show you our best
            products and services. You have to give us your permission to do
            this. If you change your mind about what info we hold just contact
            us and we will make the necessary changes. Please keep reading
            because my legal team wrote something much more professional to help
            you understand the rules better.

            <br />
            This privacy statement (the “Privacy Policy”) aims to give you

          <h2>2. Who are we?</h2>
          <p>
            HOPE is a UK registered charity number 1183873, and HOPE 3G is a UK
            company registered number 12945338, both located at 8th Floor, 140
            London Wall, London, EC2Y 5DN.
            <br />
            <br />
            Established in 2004, HOPE is a disaster relief agency dedicated to
            providing for the needs of victims of disaster. Initially, HOPE was
            formed for the public benefit to provide relief and assistance to
            the victims of war, natural disaster, trouble or catastrophe. Since
            2019, we have been approved to establish a charitable organisation
            that would be free to assist children with their education on a
            needs-assessed basis, in line with the principles established by the
            United Nations. The organisation is now run, with the support of
            HOPE 3G, for the public benefit of the provision of digital
            education using tools available to the end-user and educational
            establishments. Designed to help community groups and parents, who
            would normally be prevented from accessing such tools due to the
            associated cost incurred or as a result of disaster.
            <br />
            <br />
            HOPE 3G generally is the data controller responsible for making
            decisions about how we use your Personal Data.

          <h2>3. What Personal Data we collect and how we use it? </h2>
          <p>
            Our Services are designed to enable you to interact in shared
            animated worlds blended with information from the real world. To
            provide the Services we need information about you and the children
            you supervise, and we only use that information where we have legal
            right to do so.
            <br />
            <br />
            This Privacy Policy covers our use of any Personal Data. It does not
            cover information which cannot be used to identify you (“Anonymous
            Data”).
            <br />
            <br />
            The Personal Data we collect about you may include your name, postal
            address, email address, telephone number, first name and date of
            birth of the teacher(s) and teacher assistant(s). We will also
            collect the first name only (or nickname if you prefer) and date of
            birth of the children under your supervision – see section ‎7 below.
            We do not collect “sensitive personal data” (including genetic data,
            biometric data where processed to uniquely identify an individual)
            about you and/or the children you supervise. We may collect personal
            data from you and/or the children under your supervision when you:

            5. For how long do we keep your Personal Data for?{' '}
          </h2>
          <p className='how_long'>
            We keep your Personal Data for as long as we need to provide the
            Services to you and fulfil the purposes set out in this Privacy
            Policy. This is also the case for anyone that we share your
            information with and who carry out services on our behalf.
            <br />
            <br />
            When we no longer need to use your Personal Data and there is no
            need for us to keep it to comply with our legal or regulatory
            obligations, we will either remove it from our systems or anonymise
            it so that it can no longer be associated with you. When removing
            Personal Data, we will take commercially reasonable and technically
            feasible measures to make your Personal Data irrecoverable or
            irreproducible.
          </p>
          <h2 className='your_consent_heading'>6. Your consent </h2>
          <p className='your_consent'>
            In order to process your information/data we usually obtain explicit
            consent. HOPE ART will not use your Personal Data for marketing
            purposes if you have indicated that you do not wish to be contacted.
            You can change your preferences at any time by contacting us, or by
            unsubscribing via our website – See{' '}
            <a href='#get_in_touch_policy'>section 17</a> below for our contact

            <br />
            <br />
            Our Services are designed with children in mind. However, please
            note that we require parental consent and supervision for all
            children when using any HOPE ART platforms – see section 17 below.
          </p>

        <div className='policy_children privacy_backgrounds'>
          <h2>7. Children</h2>
          <p>
            As our Services are designed with children in mind, we will need to
            collect some basic information about the children to provide them
            with the best experience possible. The information will be limited
            to the Child’s first name or nickname (whichever you prefer), date
            of birth and class. It will help us suggest lessons for them to
            attend, based on their age and class, send them “happy birthday”
            celebrations, follow their progress and provide rewards for their
            progress, among other similar services. If we need to collect
            additional information for other purposes we will first seek express
            permission from the legal guardian or teacher(s).
            <br />
            <br />
            HOPE ART will only collect, use or disclose a Child’s Data with the
            Child’s consent, if he/she/they are the age needed to consent to a
            contract in their country of residence or, if younger, with the
            consent of someone with parental responsibility, a parent or legal
            guardian. It will be the nursery’s responsibility to obtain such
            consent and send it to HOPE ART together with the initial
            Documentation – see our Terms and Conditions for further information
            on the Documentation. HOPE ART will not collect, use, or disclose
            any data from a Child if them or their parent or legal guardian does
            not provide such consent.
            <br />
            <br />
            Parent(s) and legal guardian(s) have the right to review their
            Child’s Data, to have their Child’s Data deleted, and to refuse
            further collection, use, and/or disclosure of their Child’s Data by
            notifying HOPE ART. As a parent or legal guardian, you understand
            that HOPE ART has a legitimate interest in providing your Child’s
            Data collected via the Services to external providers for the sole
            purpose of administering or providing the Service.
            <br />
            <br />
            Children have the same rights as adults with regards to their
            Personal Data. This includes the right to access their Personal
            Data; request rectification; object to processing and have their
            personal data erased.
            <br />
            <br />
            If we learn that we have collected a Child’s Data without parental
            consent, we will take steps to delete such information from our
            files as soon as possible.

        <div className='legitimate privacy_backgrounds'>
          <h2>8. Legitimate interests</h2>
          <p>
            Under the DPA and Article 6 of the GDPR, our lawful basis for
            holding or processing Personal Data is ‘legitimate interest’ as it
            is necessary for HOPE ART to use this information in order to
            provide you with our Services.
            <br />
            <br />
            Broadly speaking, ‘legitimate interests’ means that we can process
            your Personal Data if we have a genuine and legitimate reason and we
            are not harming any of your rights and interests. Before doing this
            we will carefully consider and balance any potential impact on you
            and your rights. Some typical examples of when we might use this
            approach, is for preventing fraud, direct marketing, maintaining the
            security of our system, data analytics, enhancing, modifying or
            improving our Services, identifying usage trends and determining the
            effectiveness of our campaigns and fundraising.
            <br />
            <br />
            In addition, we have and rely on a legitimate interest in using your
            Personal Data as follows:

            <br />
            The DPA sets out the rights held by you, however, the GDPR expands

            This includes the right(s) to:

            You can object to HOPE ART processing your Personal Data if it is
            likely to cause, or is causing you, damage or distress. Such a

          <h2>11. How your Personal Data is transferred </h2>
          <p>
            HOPE ART operates its Services across the globe. Your Personal Data
            might be transferred and stored in a country outside of your home
            country for the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy to the
            extent permitted by applicable laws. The data protection laws in
            these countries may not be the same as in your home country.
            <br />
            <br />
            If we transfer your Personal Data we ensure that a similar degree of
            protection is provided to your Personal Data in line with UK
            legislation by ensuring that at least one of the following
            safeguards is implemented:
            <ul>
              <li>
                The country that your Personal Data is transferred to is a
                country that the UK Government has deemed to provide an adequate
                level of protection for Personal Data as the UK; or
              </li>
              <li>
                We use specific contract approved by the UK Information
                Commissioner’s Office, which give Personal Data the same
                protection as it has in the UK, when we engage with service
                providers.

            reasonable notice of any material change.
            <br />
            <br />
            It is important that the Personal Data we hold about you is accurate

          <p>
            We may pass on your information to our third-party service
            providers, suppliers, agents, subcontractors and other associated
            organisations for the purposes of completing tasks and providing
            services to you on our behalf (for example to process donations,
            repair devices and send you mailings). When we use third parties, we
            disclose only the Personal Data that is necessary to deliver the
            Services. Please be assured that we will not release your
            information to third parties for them to use as a part of their
            direct marketing purposes unless we are required to do so by law,
            for example, by a court order for the purposes of prevention of
            fraud or other crime. We are not responsible for the privacy polices
            of third party websites, we encourage you to read the individual
            privacy policies of each website you wish to visit.
            <br />
            <br />
            We share Anonymous Data with third parties for industry and market
            analysis.

            <br />
            We cooperate with government and law enforcement officials or
            private parties to enforce and comply with the law. We only share
            information about you to government or law enforcement officials or
            private parties when we reasonably believe necessary or appropriate:
            (a) to respond to claims, legal process (including subpoenas and
            warrants); (b) to protect our property, rights, and safety and the
            property, rights, and safety of a third party or the public in
            general; and (c) to investigate and stop any activity that we
            consider illegal, unethical, or legally actionable.

          <div className='cookie_text'>
            <p>
              A cookie is a small piece of information sent by a web server
              (e.g. website) to a web browser (an individual), which enables the
              server to collect information from the browser. We may place and
              access cookies and similar technology on to your computer or
              device, which are known as “first party cookies”. Cookies may also
              be placed and accessed by third parties, which are known as “third
              party cookies”.
              <br />
              <br />
              Cookies can help web browsers (individuals) have a better
              experience as they allow web servers (websites) to understand
              which areas are of particular interest. We may also use “web
              beacons” (also known as web bugs, pixel tags, or clear GIFS) which
              are small graphics with a unique identifier that may be included
              on our Services for example to deliver or communicate with
              cookies, to track and measure the performance of our Services, and
              to monitor how many visitors view our Services. Unlike cookies,
              which are stored on a user’s hard drive or device, web beacons are
              typically embedded invisibly on web pages (or in an email).
              <br />
              <br />
              Our cookies are not used to identify you personally. Cookies
              collect anonymous information on the pages visited. We do not use
              advertising cookies.
              <br />
              <br />
              Most browsers allow you to turn off cookies, however, by turning
              cookies off you may restrict your use of our website. Also when
              you first visit our website you are given the opportunity to
              opt-out of cookies, but please be aware that this may restrict the
              use of our website.

                </li>
                <li>
                  Performance cookies: these are cookies which collect
                  information about how and when you and other visitors interact
                  with our Services (e.g. pages viewed most often) and the
                  information collected by these cookies is used to improve how
                  our Services work.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Functionality cookies: these are cookies that allow our
                  Services to remember choices you have made (such as your login
                  information) and provide you with content and features which
                  are customised to you. For example, providing you with
                  relevant content by using a cookie to remember which region

              Services as some third party service providers that we engage may
              place their own cookies on your hard drive or on the device. These
              cookies may provide information to those third parties about your
              browsing habits or may be used for security.

              third party websites and services that are not hosted by HOPE ART.
