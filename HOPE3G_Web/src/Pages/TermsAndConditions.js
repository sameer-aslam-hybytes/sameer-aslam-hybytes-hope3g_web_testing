But for some reason it's about the rules for using our services - not to do with school term times or weather conditions like I first thought. Please don't be confused like I was! </p>
            <p>If you don't agree with at least some of the rules then you might not be able to use our website. That would be really sad â˜¹. Our website is made for children but it is important to have parents watching and helping too. Please click and learn more coz my legal team wrote something more professional and you should read it to understand the rules better. Learn more below</p>

            <p>Humanitarian Operations CIO is a disaster relief organisation that was founded in 2004 and is dedicated to addressing the needs of victims of catastrophes. We are a registered charity under the number 1183873 and located at 1 Paris Garden, London, SE1 8ND. HOPE was initially founded for the public benefit and to assist victims of war, natural disaster, hardship or calamity. Since 2019, we sought approval to establish a charitable organisation that would be free to assist on a needs-assessed basis, in line with the principles established by the United Nations. It is now run for the public benefit of the provision of digital education under tools available to the end-user and educational establishments. It is designed to help community groups and underprivileged people who would normally be prevented from accessing such tools due to the associated cost incurred.</p>

            </ul>
            <h4>A. Acceptance Principles</h4>
            <p>We have the entire discretion to refuse a donation if we believe that the donor is involved in activities that appear to be in direct conflict with our charitable goals and objectives or in violation of any current guidelines. We will always have the charity's overall best interests in mind when deciding whether or not to accept a donation. We will use your donation as we see fit, but only to further our stated goals. </p>
            <ul className="list-content">
              <li>HOPE will not accept donations where the sources or naming of a gift falls short of the standards determined through the procedures for the ethical review of grants and:</li>
              <li>Could cause detriment to the charity's reputation;</li>

            <h4>B. Refusal of donation or gifts</h4>
            <p>If we receive donation which is unacceptable under the conditions mentioned above in clause 8.1, the Head of Finance will alert the Trustees at the earliest opportunity.
